<h1>B.COM (HONS.)</h1>
<div class="mainframe">
    <p> B.Com (Hons.) has been the flagship programme of Delhi University. Here, what you study in the classroom is
        directly applicable to your work life and the workplace.</p>

    <p>The commerce programme emphasizes on an interactive teacher-learner environment necessitated by the use of
        presentations, role plays, case studies, group discussions, educational excursions, film screenings, and the use
        of e-resources in teaching of subjects like<b> business laws, cyber laws, business economics, and e-filing of
            returns.</b></p>

    <p>Besides pursuing higher studies in the domain of commerce itself, the B.Com (Hons) is a valuable preparation for
        a variety of <b>career options in entrepreneurship, marketing, green marketing, e-commerce, advertising,
            insurance, media, school and university teaching, business research, consultancy, law, civil services
            etc.</b></p>

    <p>The commerce department is active in organizing talks, discussions, workshops, outstation trips, as well as their
        two day annual festival ‚ÄúCRUSADE‚Äù for holistic development of the students. Many of our students are also active
        in successfully managing their<b> participation in theatre, classical music and dance, art and photography, and
            NSS along with their academic pressures.</b> A team of young and enthusiastic professors await you to serve
        as your friend, philosopher, and guide.</p>
