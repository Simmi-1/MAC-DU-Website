        <br>
        The course of Physics is much sought-after on account of its unique curriculum design, job oriented nature, and
        usefulness. The course is designed to suit to the requirements of students willing to pursue masters course in
        Physics, Computer Applications, Information Technology, and other allied subjects. The college has huge infrastructure in
        terms of laboratory, Information Communication and Technology (ICT), Workshops, modern Classrooms and highly
        accomplished faculty members. The department organizes myriad events which provided a forum to students to engage in various
        activities aimed at their overall development. Keeping in view the larger interest of students, teachers of the
        department took various initiatives to arrange for guidance for students who wish to pursue M.Sc and other
        allied higher studies at Indian Institutes of Technology, IISERs etc, by qualifying the national level competitive
        examinations like JAM- Joint Admission Test and JEST- Joint Entrance Screening Test. The student are taken for field-trips and
        interaction with the experts of the field are facilitated. Teachers of the department take active interest in making our
        students attend useful science lectures outside the college too. Such interface of the department with the outside world
        of academics will go a long way in defining the changing nature of modern pedagogy. Students have also been made
        aware and inspired to take up internship at reputed research institutes like TIFR, NCRA, IIT etc.
        <br>
        To commemorate the birth anniversary of legendary physicist Albert Einstein, the department organised a lecture
        by none
        other than the famous Cosmologist and Science communicater Professor Patrick Dasgupta on the topic ‚ÄúThe
        Mysterious
        Cosmos‚Äù.
        <br>
        The course is much in demand as it lays a strong foundation for higher studies in Physics, Electronics,
        Mathematics and
        Computer Science . The faculty members of the department work together to lend guidance and skills that make the
        students more promising and employable. In the past, the students have secured good placements through the
        central
        placement process of the University. The course serves as a springboard for careers in the fields of
        Nanotechnology,
        Material Science, Electronic Science, Computer applications, Information Technology, Atomic and Nuclear Physics,
        Finance
        and Analytics etc.

        Several Institutions of excellence like Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, National Physical Laboratory,
        Indian
        Space Research Organization, Indian Metrological Department, IITs, NITs, IISERs offer promising opportunities.
        Needless
        to say, the versatility of this course makes it one of the most popular courses among aspiring students
