    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p> Maharaja Agrasen College Chemistry department is a creative, supportive and intellectually challenging
        environment
        for study and research especially in the field of chemical sciences and provides the opportunity for an
        undergraduate student to obtain a thorough fundamental knowledge of all fields of chemistry. The curriculum of
        B.Sc
        Physical Science allows chemistry students to learn fundamental chemical concepts and laboratory skills and to
        have
        ample opportunity to engage in original research with guidance from a faculty mentor. Throughout the chemistry
        curriculum lecture and laboratory courses are taught in conjunction with one another and students are encouraged
        and
        expected to use sophisticated instrumentation at all levels of the curriculum. The students of B.Sc. Physical
        Sciences (Chemistry) are well equipped to pursue Masters in Chemistry, Biotechnology, Environment Science,
        Nanotechnology and many more related fields.</p>

    <h3>RESEARCH ACTIVITIES</h3>
    <p>Teachers and students are able to carry out their research and project works utilizing these facilities.
        Innovative
        project such as <b>"Characterization of Corrosion resistance properties of hydroxy based compounds in mine water
            environment from Indian Mines Coal and empirical calculations of thermodynamic parameters"</b> were carried
        out
        by students of B.Sc Physical Science and faculty mentor. Our Students had also actively participated in the<b>"3rd
            national conference on biodiversity and climate change"</b> held in college.</p>

    <h3>WET AND DRY LABORATRIES</h3>
    <p>The department of chemistry has two well-equipped laboratories (wet and dry) with required chemicals for
        conducting
        regular practical class, project reports. Theses labs are also equipped with potentiometer, conductometer,
        UV-vis
        spectrophotometer, centrifuge machines, digital weighing balance. The instruments in labs are being extensively
        used
        for carrying out various experiments prescribed in the syllabi as well as training the students in the
        improvement
        of experimental techniques.</p>

    <h3> HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT</h3>
    <p>Proper segregation and disposal of all solid and liquid waste generated during practical is strictly
        followed.</p>

    <h3>DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARY</h3>
    <p>The departmental library has a vast collection of text books, reference books such as organic chemistry, physical
        chemistry and inorganic chemistry from publishing houses such as Oxford, PHI etc.</p>

    <h3>EDUCTIONAL VISITS</h3>
    <p>One of the departmentâ€™s missions is to apprise and encourage students to the exciting career in the fields of
        science
        and engineering. Several educational visits have been conducted so far such as JSPL, NASC Museum, IARI etc. for
        encouraging students to pursue career in the critical fields of science and technology.</p>
